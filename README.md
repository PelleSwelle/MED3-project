# MED3-project

Group project for the third semester of Medialogy, AAU CPH

Takes an input image of a hand and tries to classify that image as a sign from the ASL dictionary

Run the program simply by navigating to the directory and entering

python Main.py

this will run the program on the currently loaded image.

## Current limitations

The image of the hand must be right hand, palm towards the camera. This in theory includes the signs: A, B, D, E, F, I, K, L, M, N, S, T, U, V, W, Y

All signs are implemented, but few will work

## Current signs implemented

W
